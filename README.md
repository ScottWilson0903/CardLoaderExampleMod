## Example mod for Inscryption API made by Cyantist

This plugin is a BepInEx plugin made for Inscryption to add content using the API by Cyantist.
Examples for the following features are included in the Plugin class:
- `AddBears()`: custom cards and talking cards

## Installation (automated)
This is the recommended way to install the API on the game.

- Download and install [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) or [r2modman](https://timberborn.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/)
- Click Install with Mod Manager button on top of the [page](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/API_dev/ExampleMod/)
- Run the game via the mod manager

## Installation (manual)
To install this plugin first you need to install BepInEx as a mod loader for Inscryption. A guide to do this can be found [here](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html#where-to-download-bepinex). Inscryption needs the 86x (32 bit) mono version.

You will also need to install the [API](https://github.com/ScottWilson0903/InscryptionAPI)
To install Inscryption API you simply need to copy **API.dll** from [releases](https://github.com/ScottWilson0903/InscryptionAPI/releases) to **Inscryption/BepInEx/plugins**.

To install ExampleMod with just the default examples, you simply need to copy **ExampleMod.dll** and the **Artwork** folder from the source code zip in [releases](https://github.com/ScottWilson0903/InscryptionExampleMod/releases) to a **Cyantist-ExampleMod** folder inside **Inscryption/BepInEx/plugins**.

## Can I donate?
Donations are totally not needed, this is a passion project before anything else. If you do still want to donate though, you can buy me a coffee on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/madcyantist).
